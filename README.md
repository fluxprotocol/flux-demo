Welcome to the flux-demo repostory! Flux is a highly scalable open market protocol. Read our [Medium article](https://medium.com/@fluxmarket/flux-derivatives-on-startups-69fdc683cfe2) to learn what Flux is [all about](https://medium.com/@fluxmarket/flux-derivatives-on-startups-69fdc683cfe2).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Getting started

Let's get you settled. 

## Getting the flux-demo up and running locally. 

1.  Download the [project directory](https://github.com/fluxprotocol/flux-demo.git) using `git clone https://github.com/fluxprotocol/flux-demo.git` or by clicking this link: https://github.com/fluxprotocol/flux-demo.git 
2.  Execute `yarn start`, which will run the app in development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), open it in a browser to view it.  (Be sure to add react to yarn, if you haven't already, you can do so by `yarn add --exact react-scripts@3.4.0`)
3.  The authentication.js has to be modified accordingly because the authentication won't succeed in development mode.
4.  Congratulations! You now have a working copy of flux-demo running on your system! _Time to party_
  
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will automatically reload if you make edits.

You'll also see any lint errors in the console.
***
### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


***


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


***


### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
